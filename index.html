      Make sure they have strong passwords and authentication policies - like two factor authentication and automatic user timeouts.
      <br>
      <br>
      Advise to use an SSL certificate to enable HTTPS encryption to ensure data thats transmitted between users and their site remains secure.
      <br>
      Identifying weaknesses by conducting periodic security audits and penetration tests.
      <br>
      <br>
      Maintaining reliability of any changes coming to a codebase by implementing automatic processes like continuous deployment for integrating and
