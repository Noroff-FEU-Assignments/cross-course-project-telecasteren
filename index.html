    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Advise the client to implement security protocols that include secure hosting systems by choosing a hosting provider that offers security features like firewalls, DDoS protection, and regular backups. Make sure they have strong passwords and authentication policies - like two factor authentication and automatic user timeouts.

      Advise to use an SSL certificate to enable HTTPS encryption to ensure data that’s transmitted between users and their site remains secure. Identifying weaknesses by conducting periodic security audits and penetration tests.
      
      Maintaining reliability of any changes coming to a codebase by implementing automatic processes like continuous deployment for integrating and delivering code to production, to make sure oversights from developers are caught and flagged for rework. 
      
      Set up processes for validating and sanitazing data, and all user inputs to prevent cross-site scripting and injection attacks. Utilize HTTP security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) and X-Frame-Options for preventing certain types of attacks.
      
      Educating employees with best practices and develop a plan to handle incidents promptly to minimize damage and downtime. Reducing the amount of users with permissions and access, could reduce the impact of a potential security breach.
      
      Stay informed about security patches and system updates through patch management. Making sure their website’s CMS, plugins, frameworks and all software are always up to date. Use real-time monitoring and logging to detect, track and respond quickly to any security incident.</p>
